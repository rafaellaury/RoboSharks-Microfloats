2. `pip install gym` to install the Gym package, which is required.
3. Change directory to the floatenv folder that has `setup.py`, and `pip install -e .` to install the float environment as a package.

## Training Deep RL Models (Optional) with Stable Baselines ##
1. `pip install tensorflow==1.14.0` to install the TensorFlow package, which is required for the next package to be installed. Note that newer versions of TensorFlow are not compatible.
2. `pip install stable-baselines` to install the package containing the implementations of the RL algorithms.
