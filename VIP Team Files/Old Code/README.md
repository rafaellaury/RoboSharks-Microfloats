# This contains the previous code from when the microfloat used a Raspberry Pi for its onboard electronics

It looks like [Lagrangian.py](https://github.gatech.edu/mwoodward6/LagrangianProfiler/blob/master/Old%20Code/Lagrangian.py) is the code designed to run on the Raspberry Pi. There is also [LagrangianSerialLine.py](https://github.gatech.edu/mwoodward6/LagrangianProfiler/blob/master/Old%20Code/LagrangianSerialLine.py) which seems to have been used for manually testing the profiler out of the water (I would recommend focusing more on Lagrangian.py).

[TestControlGui.py](https://github.gatech.edu/mwoodward6/LagrangianProfiler/blob/master/Old%20Code/TestControlGUI.py) seems to be the newest version of the GUI.
