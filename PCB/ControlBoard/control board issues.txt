Design Issues:
LR62E no data lines connected
NEO-M8N/NEO-M9N D_SEL is tied to ground which disables I2C mode
Should change connection for the SD card from native to serial or talk to Dr. West and figure out what storage solution he actually wants
Should have added debug points for the ESP32 (at least pins 37 and 38 for flashing over uart)
Ideally we would like to add 2 extra external connectors to signal the ESP32 to turn everything on, probably just connect J5 pin 5 to power and 6 to a GPIO with pulldown resistor so you can pull it high by shorting the pins
Might need to come up with a method of charging the Backup Battery, even if its just adding an extra set of throughholes to clip some leads on or something

Layout Issues:
Need cutout for the USB-C port so you can actually plug a cable in
Would be nice to move U14 and U15 further up so its safer to clamp the board in a vise


Part Selection Issues:
I think the purchased headers are 1mm instead of 2.54mm, need to find the correct version
Level shifter for 1.8V was out of stock, I think its back now though
12v reg out of stock so didn't solder most of those components
LTC4419s for power source selection out of stock, soldered wire for USB5V and non-backup 3V3


Soldering Issues
Mishap with leak detect, soldered resistor onto pad
5V->3V3 regulator tore a ground pad, seems totally fine
USB protection (USBLC6) out of stock so soldered wire across the two lines
Redundant Fuse 3 replaced with wire
1.8V reg out of stock, not soldered
Termperature Humidity Pressure Sensor (BME280) is soldered but untested, might be kind of sketchy
LR62E is a little crooked, don't think it is a problem but worth keeping an eye on
Reused NEO-M8N from RUR team, it looks like they may have gotten it a little too warm, not sure if it works or not
USB D- pad damaged while fixing a different issue, ran a mod wire
D1 and D2 are super sketchy looking, might want to test those if you're going to use them


Current Power Issues:
5V Regulator needs to be tested with load applied
